This is the first version of the integration that changes the core components of the integration to async, thus we jump to a new "major" version. Please provide feedbacks on this beta since the changes are quite deep.

**_Changelog:_**
* Moves pyopnsense and coordinator to async to reduce blocking
  * _Can likely optimize the entity classes as well in a future PR_
* Change from `requests` to `aiohttp` for GET and POST calls
  * XMLRPC remains __not__ threadsafe. There are a couple of async/aio versions but I'm not sure how maintained they are. 
* Move coordinator to its own file
* Move `dict_get` to helpers file
* Add more typing hints and annotations
* Standardized case everywhere to be `OPNsense`
* Improved logging and error messages

**BREAKING CHANGE**: the official recommendation now is that the integration requires an admin role user.

## Other Changes:

* Use different swap memory endpoint that works with granular permissions
* Switch to `pf_states` endpoint so that it works with granular permissions
* Gracefully handle errors, especially permission errors and show this in the Error text
* Updated README with the revised user privileges required by the integration
* Added more type hints and annotations

This should resolve [#143](https://github.com/travisghansen/hass-opnsense/issues/143) [#148](https://github.com/travisghansen/hass-opnsense/issues/148) and similar issues.
